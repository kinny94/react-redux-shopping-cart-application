Redux - redux is a state container where you can store your application state.
A React-Redux state is maintained by 5 components.
    - Store
    - Provider
    - Actions
    - Reducers
    - Middlewares ( Optional )

React
    Smart Components - ( Containers ) - which access the application state. 
    Dumb Components - ( Presentational Components ) - no relation with redux store. we dont get or set any state from the store.

Actions are just functions holding payloads of information the reducers needs to update the state in the store.
Middlewares are optionaln, in the sense that you dont necessary need to use a Middlewares in every scenario.
Reducers have the task to replace the current state in the store with the new state.

Store -> Provider -> Actions -> Middlewares ( optional ) -> Reducers 

In redux, you should never mutate the state. Therefore always use concat instead of push in case of an array.

PURE FUNCTIONS - Redux relies on pure functions for preventing the state mutations
